        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <h3>Here is a little bit about myself</h3>
        <p>I am a University student studying computer science trying to find my place in the world. Ever since I was a kid computers always fascinated me 
		   They are wonderful, amazing machines that we take for granted today. It wasn't until I got into low level code and hardware that I truly understood
		   how complicated these machines really are. Once I learned how computers truly work it just furthered my passion for learning more. My main focus is becoming 
		   a great programmer at this point in time I don't know if I am a great programmer or a mediocre one. Whichever one I currently am I am to become a great programmer
		   I am trying to practise writing more code the proper way. I am devoting this page to all my accomplishments and failures this will be a shrine if you will to my
		   quest to become a great programmer wether I succeed or fail only time will tell</p>
