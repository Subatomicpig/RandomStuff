Comp 2659 - Missile Command
Donovan Paget & Ryan Wright

Status of the program:
	The model, raster, and render all work great. The animation, however, is only in a partially working
	state. It samples the clock and animates the default screen, but we ran into trouble getting the missile
	to draw in non 45 degree angles from the top of the screen and could not find a solution in time for the 
	deadline. The mouse and its clicks are recognized, and the missile was previously working for tracking and
	direction, but was working wrong so that was removed.
	
	Make the file using make and then run it by calling prog. The program exits upon keypress.
