        <h2><u>Oct 17th 2013</u> </h2>
        <p>Just a quick update on what is hapenning I have decided to create a GitHub I Know I should have created this a lot sooner.
			However I just didnt really see the reason too in my mind it seemed like a waste of time. However after browsing Reddit and looking
			at career advice for programmers I came across a interesting post. This post explained that even awful terribly written code can sometimes
			be very useful in getting a job.
			<br><br> 
			I just couldn't wrap my head around this concept for the longest time. It came to me in so very sudden
			it was as if someone smacked me upside the head. No one is perfect some claim to be perfect and this is where the confusion started for me. 
			When submitting my resume to prospective employers I tried to look like the poster child of work. I tried to show that I never made mistakes 
			that I never looked at the past and thought to myself I could have done better.
			<br><br>
			That's when it all clicked every interview I have ever had I was always questioned about my failures and how I handled them. This is what spawned
			the Idea to create GitHub page with all my previous work and current/unfinished code projects I am working on. It's not all failures I have some
			completed projects that in my mind are complete based on what knowledge I had at the time. These are the eternal shrines to the beginning of my quest 
			to become a programmer. 
			<br><br>
			I look at these past projects and just chuckle at how simple the errors are and how much they frustrated me at the time.
			I want to show the world how awful these creations are so that my peers can analyse and correct my mistakes to help me grow in my career path.
			It's to show that I have created programs using certain types of algorithms or that I created data structures like a bst or a hash table.
			I know I am not the best programmer in the world but the only way to improve is to analyse the mistakes made and take the defeat and learn from it.
