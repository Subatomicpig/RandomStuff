Overview: a 68000 library which contains six "helper" subroutines.  These
          include procedures for console I/O, file I/O and program
          termination.

Note: in the following doc, the notation D0.L means "register D0 as a
      longword".  D0.B means "the low byte of register D0".

SUBROUTINE: FileOpen

	PURPOSE: Opens the file "D:\TEXT.TXT" for reading, and determines
	         its size in bytes.

	INPUT: n/a

	OUTPUT: D0.L - 0 on success, negative otherwise
	        D1.L - length of file in bytes (valid only if D0.L = 0)

	NOTE: This routine looks specifically for TEXT.TXT on the virtual
	      Atari ST D:\ hard drive, i.e. inside C:\D under MS Windows.

SUBROUTINE: FileClose

	PURPOSE: Closes the file opened by FileOpen.  Must only be called
	         if FileOpen returned successfully.

	INPUT: n/a

	OUTPUT: n/a

SUBROUTINE: FileCharRead

	PURPOSE: Reads the next sequential byte from the file opened by
	         FileOpen.  Must only be called if FileOpen returned
	         successfully and unread characters still exist.

	INPUT: n/a

	OUTPUT: D0.L - the ASCII value of the byte read (undefined if file
	               not open or past EOF) in the low byte, all
	               other bytes clear

SUBROUTINE: Exit

	PURPOSE: Terminates the program.  This subroutine never returns.

	INPUT: n/a

	OUTPUT: n/a

SUBROUTINE: KybdCharRead

	PURPOSE: Waits for and reads a single character from the keyboard.

	INPUT: n/a

	OUTPUT: D0.L - The ASCII value of the character read in the low
	               byte, all other bytes clear

SUBROUTINE: ScrnCharWrite

	PURPOSE: Writes a single character to the screen.

	INPUT: D0.B - The ASCII value of the character to write.

	OUTPUT: n/a
